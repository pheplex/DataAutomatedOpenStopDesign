# Dataset: 5 Orebodies for Automated Open-Stope Design Optimization

This repository contains data for five orebodies utilized in the publication:  
**"Automated open-stope design optimization through machine learning methods"**  
You can access the article at: [International Journal of Mining, Reclamation and Environment](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17480930.2024.2437737).

## Description

The dataset provided here supports the research presented in the article, which demonstrates the use of machine learning methods for transitioning from traditional manual ore vein interpretations to an automated underground mining approach. This innovative process enables subsequent optimization models for stope design.
